-md
  ### Freelance, June 2013 to present

  I have helped a number of clients with their Python and JavaScript web development needs. On the odd occasion I've also done iOS work in Objective-C.

  ### [EveryBlock](http://everyblock.com), September 2011 to Februrary 2013

  I worked on a large Django site with a strong geographic focus. We had a PostgreSQL backend and used Celery for tasks. In particular I focused on scraping and presentation of external datasets in various formats including web pages, structured files, APIs, and even PDFs. I also helped create an internal system for the timely detection of scraping errors.

  ### [Leapfrog Online](http://leapfrogonline.com), May 2008 to September 2011

  I worked on a large Pylons app for managing ad campaigns, which had a complex GUI written in ExtJS and jQuery. Later I switched to developing a large Django app for executing cable promotions. My unique contribution was introducing frontend tests to the development process, using QUnit and PunkyBrowster.

  ### [Morningstar](http://morningstar.com), August 2005 to January 2008

  I worked on an ASP.NET app to extract data from a SQL Server database and display it as XML to end users. I also created a Python command line program to generate hundreds of T-SQL queries, ushering in the official use of Python at the company.
